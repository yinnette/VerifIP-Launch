Replace WordPress commenting with the Facebook Comments widget, quickly and easily.

== Description ==

This plugin is a drop-in solution for replacing the default WordPress commenting 
with the [Facebook Comments widget](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/).
It is far-and-away the easiest to use plugin available - just try it and see! Check it out:

* Zero configuration to get it working - just install and activate
* Imports your Facebook comments into your WordPress database for safe-keeping!
* Using [SharePress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sharepress)? Import settings automagically!
* All of your WordPress comments are retained, with option to display them below the Facebook box
* All comments are printed in hidden <noscript> blocks to maximize SEO

All you'll need is a [Facebook Application](http://aaroncollegeman.com/facebook-comments-for-wordpress/how-to-setup-facebook-comments/)
- don't worry: it's not that hard to setup, and it's free!
